1.  **Clone the repository:**

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   You need an API key from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/). It's free!
    -   Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project.
    -   Add your Pexels API key to the `.env` file like this:

    VITE_PEXELS_API_KEY=YOUR_PEXELS_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

5.  **Update the API Key usage in the code:**
    -   Open `src/App.js`.
    -   Find the line: `const API_KEY = 
    -   Replace it with the following line to use your environment variable securely:
    ```javascript
    const API_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_PEXELS_API_KEY;
    ```

6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
